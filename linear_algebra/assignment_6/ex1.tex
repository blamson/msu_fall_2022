\section*{Exercise 1}

Consider the set of vectors of length at most 1, namely $\left\{ \vec{v} = \genpmat{a\\b}, a^2 + b^2 \leq 1 \right\}$. Prove that this set is NOT a vector space.

\subsection*{Proof}

Consider the counter example with $\vec{v} = \genpmat{0\\1}$ and $\vec{u} = \genpmat{1\\0}$ so $\vec{v}, \vec{u} \in S$.

\[
	\begin{aligned}
		\vec{v} + \vec{u} &= \genpmat{1\\1} \\
	\end{aligned}
\]

As $1^2 + 1^2 \cancel{\leq} 1$, $\vec{v} + \vec{u} \notin S$. Therefore this set of vectors is not closed under vector addition and as such is not a subspace. $\blacksquare$
