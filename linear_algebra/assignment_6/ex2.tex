\section*{Exercise 2}

Consider the subset of $M_{2 \times 2}$ that contains all upper triangular matrices, namely all matrices of the form $A = \genpmat{a&b\\c&0}$. Prove that $S$ is a subspace of this vector space.

\subsection*{Proof}

Let 
\[
	\begin{aligned}
		S &= \left\{ \genpmat{a&b\\c&0}, a,b,c \in \R \right\}, \\ 
		\vec{v} &= \genpmat{x_1 & x_2 \\ x_3 & 0}, \\ 
		\vec{u} &= \genpmat{y_1 & y_2 \\ y_3 & 0}
	\end{aligned}
\] 

So, $\vec{v}, \vec{u} \in S$. Also let $\alpha$ be any scalar in $\R$.

It follows that:

\[\vec{v} + \vec{u} = \genpmat{x_1 + y_1 & x_2 + y_2 \\ x_3 + y_3 & 0}\]

As $\vec{v} + \vec{u} \in S$, $S$ is closed under vector addition.

It also follows that:

\[\alpha \vec{v} = \genpmat{\alpha x_1 & \alpha x_2 \\ \alpha x_3 & 0}\]

As $\alpha \vec{v} \in S$, $S$ is also closed under scalar multiplication.

There is also nothing restricting the existence of some vector $\vec{w}$ with $a=b=c=0$, so $\vec{0} \in S$.

As $S$ is closed under vector addition, scalar multiplication and also contains the zero vector, it is a subspace of $M_{2 \times 2}$. $\blacksquare$
