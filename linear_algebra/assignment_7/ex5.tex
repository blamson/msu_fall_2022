\section*{Exercise 5}

Find the parameter $t$ such that the matrix 

\[A = \genpmat{4&1&2\\4&0&3\\4&2&t}\]

is NOT invertible.

To solve this problem we just need to find a value of $t$ that results in a determinant of 0.

\[
	\begin{aligned}
		det(A) &= 12 + 16 - 4t - 24 \\
		0 &= 4 - 4t \\
		t &= 1
	\end{aligned}
\]
