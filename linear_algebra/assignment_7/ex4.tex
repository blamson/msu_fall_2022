\section*{Exercise 4}

Find the determinants for the following transformation matrices.

\subsection*{Part A}

\[
M = 
\genpmat{
	1/5&2/5\\
	2/5&4/5
}
\]

The transformation that projects the plane onto the $y = 2x$ line.

\[
	\begin{aligned}	
		det(M) &= (4/5) - (4/5) \\
		&= 0
	\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{Part B}

\[
M = 
\genpmat{
	\frac{1}{1+m^2} & \frac{m}{1+m^2} \\
	\frac{m}{1+m^2} & \frac{m^2}{1+m^2}
}
\]

The transformation that projects the plane onto the $y = mx$ line.

\[det(M) = 
	\frac{m^2}{(1+m^2)^2} - \frac{m^2}{(1+m^2)^2} = 0
\]

\subsection*{Part C}

Using your answers above, what can you say about projection transformations?

The determinants of both are zero, this indicates that projects are NOT invertible, NOT reverisble and are NOT linear transformations.
