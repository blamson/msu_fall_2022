\section*{Problem 5}

Find parameters $h, k$ such that the system of equations below has infinitely many solutions.

\[
	\begin{cases}
		x_1 - 3x_2 = 1 \\
		2x_1 + hx_2 = k
	\end{cases}
\]

Solving the top equation for $x_1$ gives us:

\[x_1 = 3x_2 + 1\]

So we can rewrite the second equation as:

\[
	\begin{aligned}
		6x_2 + 2 + hx_2 &= k \\
		(6 + h)x_2 &= k-2
	\end{aligned}
\]

To get infinitely many solutions from this we need $x_2$ to be a free variable, that means the second equation needs to result in $0 = 0$.

So, to get 0 on the lefthand side we need $h = -6$, and on the righthand side we need $k = 2$.
