\section*{Exercise 3}

Consider the subspace of $M_{2 \times 2}$ that contains all invertible matrices, 

$S = \left\{ A \in M_{2 \times 2} | A^{-1} \; \text{exists} \right\}$. 

Prove that $S$ is NOT a subspace of this vector space.

\subsection*{Proof}

Consider the counter-example.

Let 

\[
	\begin{aligned}
		S &= \left\{ A \in M_{2 \times 2} | A^{-1} \; \text{exists} \right\}, \\
		\vec{v} &= \genpmat{0&1\\2&0}, \\
		\vec{u} &= \genpmat{1&1\\2&8}
	\end{aligned}
\]

As both $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$ are invertible, both are in $S$. From this though we see that

\[\vec{v} + \vec{u} = \genpmat{1&2\\4&8}\]

which is not invertible as its columns are not linearly independent.

Therefore, $S$ is not closed under vector addition and is not a subspace of $M_{2 \times 2}$. $\blacksquare$
