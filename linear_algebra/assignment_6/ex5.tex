\section*{Exercise 5}

Let $V_0 \subset V$ be a subspace in $V$. Prove that $\vec{0v} \in V_0$.

\subsection*{Proof}

Let $V_0 \subset V$ be a subspace in $V$.

Therefore $V_0$ is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.

From this it follows that scaling by the number 0 is allowed. So, for $ \forall \vec{v} \in V_0$,

\[0 \cdot \vec{v} = \vec{0}\]

As any subspace must be closed under scalar multiplication, any subspace must therefore have the zero vector as it is the result of scaling any vector by 0. $\blacksquare$.
