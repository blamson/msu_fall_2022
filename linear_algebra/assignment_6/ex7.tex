\section*{Exercise 7}

Give an example of two subspaces $V_0 \subset \R^3$ and $V_1 \subset \R^3$ such that $V_0 \cup V_1$ is NOT a subspace in $\R^3$.

\subsection*{Answer}

Consider the situation where $V_0$ and $V_1$ are two separate planes. 

\[
	\begin{aligned}
		V_0 &= \left\{ (x,0,z)^T \in \R^3 | x,z \in \R \right\} \\
		V_1 &= \left\{ (x,y,0)^T \in \R^3 | x,y \in \R \right\} 
	\end{aligned}
\]

So, anything in $V_0 \cup V_1$ is trapped to either plane. So, x, y and z cannot all be non-zero simultaneously. If there is a means to leave these planes using either vector addition or scalar multiplication, this union is not a subspace. 

Consider $\vec{x_1} = (1,0,1)^T$ which is in $V_0$ and $\vec{x_2} = (1,1,0)^T$ which is in $V_1$. 

\[\vec{x_1} + \vec{x_2} = (2,1,1)^T \notin V_0 \cup V_1\]

Therefore, this union is not closed under vector addition and is not a subspace in $\R^3$.
