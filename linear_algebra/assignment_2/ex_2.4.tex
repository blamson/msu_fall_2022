\section*{Exercise 2.4}

\textbf{Problem:} Write down a basis for the space of

\subsection*{2.4a} $3 \times 3$ symmetric matrices;

We can use similar logic to exercise 2.3 here, but it's important to note that a $3 \times 3$ is obviously larger than a $2 \times 2$. We can't just take for granted a simple $n - 1$ count for basis vectors as we now have more points in the matrix that match. Let's take a look at a generic $3 \times 3$ matrix transpose.

\[
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		a & b & c \\
		d & e & f \\
		g & h & i
	\end{Bmatrix}^T
=
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		a & d & g \\
		b & e & h \\
		c & f & i
	\end{Bmatrix}
\]

From this transpose we can take note of the values that need to be the same. That is the following:

\[
	\begin{aligned}
		b &= d \\
		c &= g \\
		f &= h
	\end{aligned}
\]

We have three sets of matching points. That means three pairs of points that can each be controlled by their own scalar which results in $(3 \cdot 3) - 3 = 6$ basis vectors necessary.

Our basis in this case is $S = \left\{ \vec{e_{1}}, \vec{e_{2}}, \vec{e_{3}}, \vec{e_{4}} \vec{e_{5}}, \vec{e_{6}}\right\}$.

\[
	\begin{aligned}
	\vec{e_{1}} &= \begin{Bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{Bmatrix} &
	\vec{e_{2}} &= \begin{Bmatrix}
		0 & 1 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{Bmatrix} &
	\vec{e_{3}} &= \begin{Bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{Bmatrix} \\
	\vec{e_{4}} &= \begin{Bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{Bmatrix} &
	\vec{e_{5}} &= \begin{Bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 \\
	\end{Bmatrix} &
	\vec{e_{6}} &= \begin{Bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 1 \\
	\end{Bmatrix}
	\end{aligned}
\]
