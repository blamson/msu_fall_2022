\section*{Exercise 2.3}

Recall, that a matrix is called \emph{symmetric} if $A^T = A$. Write down a basis in the space of \emph{symmetric} $2 \times 2$ matrices. How many elements are in the basis?

For this problem I find it useful to visualize a symmetric transpose. This requires square matrices. With a square transpose it is important to remember the top left and bottom right cells stay where they are.  

\[
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		a & b \\
		c & d
	\end{Bmatrix}^T
= 
\begin{Bmatrix}
	a & c \\
	b & d
\end{Bmatrix}
\]

For the transpose to be equal to the original matrix there is a restriction; that $b = c$. This is critical here. Normally a matrix with $n$ elements is going to require $n$ basis vectors to create a basis, but that's not the case here. Because the top right and bottom left need to be the same, they can both be handled by one scalar. So, a basis can be accomplished with $n - 1$ basis vectors.

Here we have $S = \{e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}\}$ as our basis.

\[
\begin{aligned}
e_{1} &= 
\begin{Bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0
\end{Bmatrix}
\\ 
e_{2} &= 
\begin{Bmatrix}
	0 & 1 \\
	1 & 0
\end{Bmatrix}
\\
e_{3} &= 
\begin{Bmatrix}
	0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\]
